# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis-

### Linear Regress to Predict MPG
###The purpose of this analysis was to:
1. Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

Weight,spolier and angle, AWD provided a non random amount of variance. 

2. Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

Slope is not at zero, looking at p-valiue which is under 0.05

3. Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not? 

    Our R-squared value is 71%, which means roughly 71% of the time the model will predict the mpg values on correct terms. Simple way to help is to incres the size of the module data.

## Summary Statistics

   1. Lot 1 has a variance less than 1psi, so it currently meets design specifications.
   2. Lot 2 has a variance less than 7.5psi, so it currently meets design specifications.
   3. Lot 3 has a variance greater than 170psi, so it currently DOES NOT meet design specifications.
